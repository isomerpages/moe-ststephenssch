<p>Giving to St Stephen’s School</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for considering making a donation to the school. As a Government-Aided
school, we need to pay for our share of running expenses as well as Lasallian
and Catholic programmes and activities not provided for by Government Grants.
As a non-revenue generating organisation, we continually need sources of
funds to keep these programmes which gives our school its unique identity
running. As such, we need the financial support of the community and your
generous support and donations, big or small, is deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many causes within the school that your donations can support,
like our needy pupils, and you can determine where your donations will
support. We hope that you can pay it forward, and invest in the growth
and development of future Stephenians!</p>

totally to you may receive you totally.”</p>
