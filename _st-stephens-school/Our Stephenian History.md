##### Brief History of St. Stephen's School

<img src="/images/osh1.png" style="width:203px;height:440px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> St. Stephen's School is one of the six Christian Brothers' Schools (CBS) of the De La Salle Order in Singapore. The School, founded on a piece of private land bounded by Siglap View, La Salle Street and Siglap Avenue, was first envisioned by Rev. Br. Stephen Barkley who saw, amidst the coconut palm trees and the rubber estates in the eastern part of the island, a school that would be able cater to the growing number of boys.

  

In 1953, Rev. Bro. Lawrence Robles became the Brother Director of St. Patrick's School. He purchased a piece of land for the development of a primary and feeder school for St. Patrick's. The construction of the school building began in 1956 and was completed in 1957. The new school was named, appropriately, St. Stephen's School, after Rev. Bro. Stephen, whose patron saint, St. Stephen, was the first martyr of Christianity.
