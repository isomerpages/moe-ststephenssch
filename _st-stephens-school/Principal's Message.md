### Principal's Message

Welcome to St Stephen's School!

  

We are a Catholic and Lasallian school founded by St John Baptist De La Salle, who is the Patron Saint of Teachers, and are part of a global family of Lasallian schools.

  

In our uncertain world, I believe that the best assurance in preparing our boys for their future is for each boy to be grounded in the certainty of our values of faith, service and community. Faith is our foundation, service is our way and community is our support. We have a strong emphasis on character development, and believe that there is a leader in everyone. We aim to help each boy discover himself and feel valued, and our ultimate goal is for each boy who passes through the school to respond to the call to love and serve others. As a Lasallian school, we strive to be inclusive, and aim to awaken the spiritual side of every boy. As a Catholic school, we will share the Gospel values, but do not believe in imposing it.

  

As a school, we strive to develop each boy that has been entrusted to our care in a holistic manner, providing him with a human and Christian education. Here at St Stephen's, our mission is to enable youth in a Lasallian community to learn how to learn and to learn how to live; empowering them to be men of integrity and men for others. Our academic programmes are refreshed regularly with the aim of helping all mainstream boys to be engaged in learning to build a strong foundation and reach their academic potential. We also strongly believe in providing a rich learning experience through the range of CCAs that we highly encourage our boys to take part in.

  

As a Government-Aided school, we are supported by MOE and align our curriculum and policies with MOEâ€™s desired outcomes and directives. We receive funding from MOE to run the school, but we also rely on the help of our generous community of parents and alumni to pay it forward to contribute financially and in kind to support future generations of boys who come through the school.

  

It is my dream for all our boys who come to St Stephen's to enter to learn, and leave to serve, especially the last, lost and the least in their midst.

  

Credere et Servire!
