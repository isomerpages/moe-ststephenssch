### Our School Rally

#### SCHOOL RALLY - Alma Mater's Call

_Music based on the Irish song O'Donnell Abu (1567)_

_Lyrics by Brother Marcian James Cullen (1869-1938)_

  

All through Saint Stephen's, a voice is resounding,<br>
Promptly respond to your duty's sweet call,<br>
Harken you all for the trumpet is sounding,<br>
Your mater's proclaiming her watchword to all.

  

Forward her children dear,<br>
Ever with hearts sincere,<br>
Render with joy to your mater her due.<br>
All that is vile reject,<br>
Heaven will e'er protect<br>
Sons of Saint Stephen's<br>
Valiant and true.

  

Onward and upward in life's earnest battle,<br>
Joyously bearing the brunt of the fight,<br>
Nobly forgiving for all that may pain you,<br>
And bravely defending the cause of the right.

  

Forward her children dear,<Br>
Ever with hearts sincere,<br>
Render with joy to your mater her due.<br>
All that is vile reject,<br>
Heaven will e'er protect<br>
Sons of Saint Stephen's<br>
Valiant and true.

##### ABOUT the School Rally

_The School Rally is shared by all the Lasallian schools in Singapore. For our school's version, the original phrase "our college" in stanza 1 verse 1 is replaced by "Saint Stephen's", and similarly in the Chorus, our institution's name takes the place in the verse "Sons of Saint Stephen's"._

#### Glorious Patron

Saint John Baptist, Holy Founder<br>
Friend and father of the young<br>
Patron of Lasallian teachers<br>
We acknowledge you in song<br>
Thanking God we proudly name you<br>
Patron and Protector strong

  

You became a friend to children<br>
To the needy kind and good<br>
You were sent to show compassion<br>
Making God's word understood<br>
Saint John Baptist, Holy Founder<br>
Model of our brotherhood

##### ABOUT Glorious Patron

_Glorious Patron pays tribute to our founder, Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle (1651-1719), the Patron Saint of Teachers of Youth and founder of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, and it reminds all of us of his life-long work in bringing education to the poor and his mission to tend to "the last, the lost and the least"._

_This is also the melody that Stephenians hum to at the end of each day - the final school bell of the day ringing out this popular tune as the boys make their way out into the hallways and corridors._

#### We Are Lasallian


We come from all nations, united in our cause<br>
We share a common vision, we see the same bright star<br>
What race or creed it matters not, so tall and proud we stand<br>
We hail you Saint John Baptist, we are Lasallian

  

Our Founder, Saint La Salle, was born of noble Rheims<br>
He lived a life of privilege, but heard a higher call<br>
It was for the children, the last the lost, the least<Br>
For whom he gave up wealth and fame as the first Lasallian

  

*We are one, but we are many* <br>
*And from all the lands of earth we come* <Br>
*We share a dream, and sing with one voice* <br>
*I am, you are, we are Lasallian*

  

Our faith, our foundation, no matter how we pray<br>
To the poor we give our service<br>
To brighten up their day<br>
We are a community, each other we uphold<br>
Our motto Signum Fidei<br>
Join us both young and old

  

*We are one, but we are many* <br>
*And from all the lands of earth we come* <br>
*We share a dream, and sing with one voice* <br>
*I am, you are, we are Lasallian* <br>

  

Today the need remains, for men like De La Salle<br>
Continuing his mission<br>
Working for the good of all<br>
We are siblings to each other, across all walks of life<br>
And we shall ever shine like stars through trial by fire and strife

  

*We are one, but we are many* <br>
*And from all the lands of earth we come* <br>
*We share a dream, and sing with one voice* <br>
*I am, you are, we are Lasallian*
