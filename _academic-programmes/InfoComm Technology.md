<h3>ICT</h3>
<h4>Subject Philosophy</h4>
<p>At St Stephen’s School, we aim to develop our students to be future-ready
and responsible digital learners who navigate technology safely and ethically.
To achieve this:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We provide quality learning experiences through intentional technology
integration, ensuring that every learner is empowered with the right digital
tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We focus our ICT programme to develop 21st-century competencies, aligned
with MOE’s EdTech2030 outcomes, focusing on critical thinking, collaboration,
and digital literacy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>Our mission is to cultivate a pervasive ICT culture that seamlessly integrates
technology into teaching and learning, empowering Stephenians to become
responsible and ethical digital citizens.</p>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>We envision all Stephenians to be current, discerning, and responsible
users of ICT, equipped with the skills to effectively and safely leverage
technology for learning.</p>
<h4>Subject Approach</h4>
<p>All IP subjects have ICT plans for P1 to P6 students that provide opportunities
for our students to learn using technology.</p>
<h4>Subject Approach</h4>
<p>The school adopts a structured digital literacy progression from Primary
1 to 6, focusing on foundational ICT skills, digital citizenship, and emerging
technologies like AI literacy.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>From Primary 1 to 3, students engage in light digital device usage with
a focus on digital safety, basic ICT operations, and keyboarding skills,
laying a strong foundation for responsible technology use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As they progress to Primary 4 to 6, technology integration becomes more
intentional and immersive, incorporating problem-solving, coding, and AI
literacy to enhance learning and develop future-ready competencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructional Programme departments (English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics
and Science) integrate technology for engaged learning. Home-Based Learning
(HBL) is leveraged to reinforce self-directed learning through the Student
Learning Space (SLS).</p>
<p>The Cyber Wellness Programme, a collaboration between ICT, CCE, and Student
Management (SM), educates students on MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework, promoting
safe, responsible, and ethical digital practices.</p>
<p>By seamlessly integrating digital literacy, instructional programme (IP)
departments' technology-enabled learning, and cyber wellness education
into the curriculum, the school empowers students with essential ICT competencies,
fosters responsible digital citizenship, and equips them to navigate an
increasingly digital world with confidence and discernment.</p>
