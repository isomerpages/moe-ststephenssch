### English

#### Subject Philosophy

The subject philosophy is to empower all learners to attain foundational and functional literacy, so that English can be readily employed in everyday life for various purposes. In addition to functional literacy, it is also to enable the majority of our pupils to attain competence in speaking, reading and writing, so that they may find joy in learning English and take their learning to greater heights.

  

#### Mission

The mission of the English Language Department is to provide a strong foundation and rich learning in English for all students.

  

#### Vision

We aim to develop Stephenians to be versatile and effective users of the English Language.

  

#### Subject Approach

Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading (STELLAR)

  

The STELLAR programme aims to strengthen language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards the learning of English. Underpinning the STELLAR model are three teaching strategies, which are the Shared Book Approach, the Modified Language Experience Approach and Learning Centres.

  

STELLAR also complements the school-based curriculum to provide drilling and rigour to the learning and acquisition of language skills.
