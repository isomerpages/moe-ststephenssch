<h3>Catholic Programmes</h3>
<p>As a Catholic mission School, St Stephenâ€™s offers key Catholic programmes
such as daily morning prayer in the chapel, weekly Catechism classes, penitential
service, and masses on days of obligation for Catholic boys. As a school,
we also mark the liturgical seasons such as Lent and Easter and hold masses
before exams and at the start and end of the academic year.</p>
