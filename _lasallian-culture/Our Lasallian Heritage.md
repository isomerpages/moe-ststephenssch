### Our Lasallian Heritage

<img src="/images/olh1.png" style="width:80%">

The Stephenian experience is anchored on our Lasalllian mission and Stephenian heritage. We hope to develop our pupils into _"men of integrity and men for others"_, tending to _"the last, the lost and the least"_. This is echoed in our motto, _"Credere et Servire"_ which translates to ‘To Believe and To Serve”.

The Mission of the Christian Brothers Schools is to form a community where teachers and students can live their faith and become the people that God wants them to be.

#### The School Community

WE BELIEVE that the love of Christ binds us together as children of God, people of all races and conditions, rich or poor, bright or otherwise, for all are made in God's image and members of His family. On this faith rests the mutual love and respect that is fostered between teacher and student in our Schools. 

WE BELIEVE that the Brothers and their lay colleagues give testimony to the Providence and the Presence of God as they educate the young in the tradition of St. John Baptist De La Salle, giving attention to all and especially to pupils whose development is hindered by economic, personal and other problems.

#### Learning and Living the Faith

WE BELIEVE that the learning of religious truth is fundamental to education in our schools.

WE BELIEVE that religious development is not isolated from development of the mind and conscience, nor from development of the body. Logic and analysis, honesty and team-work in games, all provide a sound foundation for understanding religion and living by one's beliefs.

WE BELIEVE that our Schools must teach what is true, just, good and beautiful, guided by our Catholic philosophy which finds harmony not contradiction, in spirit and matter, in faith and reason.

#### Life-Long Growth

WE BELIEVE that, like parents, teachers labour to form the minds and characters of students and become transformed in the process, as teacher and student help each other grow as persons.

WE BELIEVE that students must learn how to learn as they need to teach themselves after leaving school.

#### Success

WE BELIEVE that success in school means more than good examination results. It means learning how to live as well as how to make a living.
