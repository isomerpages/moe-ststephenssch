### Positive Education

St Stephen’s School has embarked on our Positive Education journey.

  

Our vision is for them not only to be Stephenian Gentlemen but also “caring, confident and independent learners” of tomorrow.

  

With this, we have created a GROW framework:

  

GROW is an acronym referring to the four core attributes of:

  

**G**ratitude

  

**R**elationship

  

**O**ptimism

  

**W**ell-being.
