### SSOBA

**St Stephen’s Old Boys Association (SSOBA)**

  

We will be celebrating our 65th Anniversary in 2022 and we have seen many cohorts and generations of boys graduate.

Our old boys - Sons of St. Stephen's - have continued their good times and are providing their strongest support for the alma mater through SSOBA, the St. Stephen's Old Boys Association.

  

Old boys, come reconnect via
