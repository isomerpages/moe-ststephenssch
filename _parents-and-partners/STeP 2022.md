##### Question 3: What is Mobile Device Management (MDM)?

 MDM allows the school and parents to control the use of the iPad.  
We will be using Mobile Device Management (MDM) software to manage the iPads.  
The school has subscribed to Mosyle Manager for MDM. The MDM yearly subscription and support cost is $22 and this will be deducted through your son’s Edusave Account.  
The MDM allows the school to remotely install school approved apps and to block other apps and websites as needed

  

  

##### Question 4: Can I use an iPad Mini?

  

We do not recommend the iPad Mini due to its limited screen space which presents difficulties for your child's eye health and might also make it challenging for your child to use during lessons.
