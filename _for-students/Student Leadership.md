### Student Leadership

The development of pupils as leaders is critical in all Stephenians. Every pupil is encouraged to take on leadership positions as part of their character development in St. Stephen’s School.

  

Our Leadership Structure is based on the principle that “Every Pupil A Leader, Every Stephenian A Servant Leader”.
